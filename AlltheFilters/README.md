Here is a project that takes an image from your computer and applies selected filters to it. The user gets to choose what filters to apply and the program will save it onto their computer.

filtergram.py: run this file in order to interact with the user and pictures
filters.py: contains a whole set of functions that will open the image, save the image, and apply filters to the image
linda.jpg: this is a sample picture that I was using to test the filter functions
